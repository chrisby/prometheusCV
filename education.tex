	I am a \highlight{culture hero} and \highlight{trickster figure} who created humanity from clay, and who defies the gods by stealing fire and giving it to humanity as civilization. I am known for my \highlight{intelligence} and for being a champion of humankind. I am also seen as the author of the human arts and sciences generally. This is why I can use `I' in an CV; you, however, should not~(at least that's what they say).}
